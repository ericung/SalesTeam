# Sales Team

Where does the sales team fit in if the product generates revenue?

### Salesman

Take the Ideal Manager Theorem and represent the variable, Personality, as the salesman.

$IdealSalesman = Personality = Groundwork \cdot Reputation \cdot Ideas \cdot Trust$

The base pay for a car salesman in Minnesota is $48,500.

$`48500\div 2080 = 23.18 `$

$`23.18 / MinimumWage = 23.18 / 7.5 = 3.18 \approx 4`$

Then, $`IdealSalesman >= 4`$

The ideal salesman has a multiplier value 4 or more.

### Groundwork

What is groundwork for the salesman?

If we start at the beginning, what does it take to build a company as an individual?

### Reputation

How does a salesman sell his product as an individual?

### Ideas

Where does a salesman get his ideas from?

### Trust

Can this salesman be trusted to provide you their product or service?

### Car Dealership

$`SalesTeam = {Salesman1, Salesman2, ,..., SalesmanI,..., SalesmanN} such that all SalesmanI, 1 <= I <= N, are in [0,1)`$

$`IdealSalesTeam = {IdealSalesman1, IdealSalesman2,..., IdealSalesman,..., IdealSalesmanN} such that all IdealSalesman have a multiplier \geq 4 `$

$`SalesTeamMultiplier = Product(SalesTeam\union {1})\cdot Product(IdealSalesTeam) \geq 4`$

$`DealershipRevenue = SalesTeamMultiplier\cdot Product({InventoryItemK*UnitsSoldK such that K is in [1,M]`})$
